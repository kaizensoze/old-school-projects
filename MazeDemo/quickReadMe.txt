Some Problems (12/14/04)

-The stop button freezes the app every now and then.

-The JList causes an error to be displayed in the console. It does not affect the application. I think it is a java swing time error since the JList is being updated so quickly. 

-The maze cells are not marked.

-You cannot change the size of the maze.


These are just a few of the things that I'm well aware of. If you have any other problems, email me at jgallo@student.umass.edu. 

Do whatever you want with the code.
